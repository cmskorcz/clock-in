# Clock-In
## Purpose
To allow for a user to log in using a unique username and password and to clock into or out of either class hours or lab hours. The time a user clocks either in or out will be tied to the username in a database, as well as whether that person clocked into either class or lab. If a user is clocked in already, they should not be able to clock in again; likewise for clocking out. In order to sign up, a use must create a unique username, a password, and enter in an access code provided by the instructor. The instructor will have administrative access and be able to access the students' timesheet.
